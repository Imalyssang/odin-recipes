            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum <em>(Omit if your gluten free flour blend 
                already contains xanthan gum.)</em></li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups (225g) peeled and coarsely grated carrots <em>3-4 medium sized</em></li>
            <li>3/4 cup (90 g) walnuts, roughly chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cream cheese frosting</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup (170g) cream cheese, cold from the fridge</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (175g) heavy/double cream, cold from the fridge</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (80g) icing sugar, sifted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>walnuts, roughly chopped, for decoration</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <h3>Gluten free carrot cake</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 180ºC and 
                line a 9-inch (23cm) square baking tin with baking paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the light brown sugar, oil, eggs and 
                vanilla until well combined.</li>
            <li>Sift in the gluten free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum,
                 salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Whisk everything together into a smooth batter with no flour clumps.</li>
            <li>Add the coarsely grated carrots and roughly chopped walnuts, and 
                fold them into the batter until they're evenly distributed throughout.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter into the lined baking tin and smooth out the top.</li>
            <li>Bake at 180ºC for about 35 minutes or until well risen, golden-brown on
                 top and an inserted cake tester comes out clean. If the cake starts
                 browning too quickly, cover it with a sheet of aluminium foil (shiny side up)
                 and continue baking until done.</li>
            <li>Allow the cake to cool in the baking tin for about 10-15 minutes, then
                 transfer it out of the tin onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>    
        </ol>

        <h3>Cream cheese frosting</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer, if using), whisk the cream
                 cheese until it's smooth and looser in texture.</li>
            <li>Add the heavy/double cream, icing sugar and vanilla, and whisk until soft
                 peaks form. The frosting should keep its shape when you swirl it around
                 with a spoon or a rubber spatula – you don't want it too loose or runny,
                 but be careful not to over-whip it as that can make it too stiff and too thick.</li>
            <li>Spread the cream cheese frosting on top of the cooled carrot cake all the
                 way to the edges, using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to
                 add some decorative swirls and swoops.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle on some extra chopped walnuts as decoration, slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
