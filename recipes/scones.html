    <h1>Scones Recipe</h1>

    <p>My late uncle taught me how to bake scones. He resembled my father, 
        who passed away when I was seven years old. After my uncle passed away last year, 
        this recipe became a nostalgic reminder of the memories they left behind.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (240g) gluten-free 1:1 baking flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar <em>reduce to 1 tablespoon for savory scones</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (113g) butter <em>frozen</em></li>
        <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract <em>omit for savory scones</em></li>
        <li>sparkling sugar for topping</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add the butter to the flour mixture and combine 
            with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream, egg and vanilla until well-combined.</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, stir the sour cream mixture into the flour mixture until no dry bits of flour remain.</li>
        <li>Spread out a large piece of plastic wrap. Using wet hands, transfer the dough to the plastic wrap.
            Clean and wet your hands again then pat the dough to form a 6-inch round that is 1-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Then freeze for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 260°C. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, take the dough out of the freezer. Spray a sharp knife with cooking spray and cut the dough
             into 6 equal wedges. Arrange the scones on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired.</li>
        <li>Place the scones in the oven, then immediately lower the oven temperature to 220°C. <em>You want the oven temperature
             to start hot so the scones turn golden brown as they cook through.</em> Bake for 12-14 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven. Transfer the scones to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes before serving.</li>
