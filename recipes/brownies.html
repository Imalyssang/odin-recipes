    <p>If you have never baked brownies before, here is your chance to make rich, 
        gluten-free brownies to enjoy at home.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons (140g) salted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (85g) high quality semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (105g) brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs and 1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon espresso powder <em>(optional)</em></li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (25g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (115g) gluten-free 1:1 baking flour</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips (for mixing in)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C. Grease a 9x9 baking dish with cooking
             spray and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into tablespoon-sized pieces. Add the butter and 
            chocolate chips to a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds. 
            Stir well, microwave for another 15 seconds and then stir well again.  
            Repeat for 15 seconds until chocolate and butter are completely melted and well-combined.</li>
        <li>Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar to the butter mixture 
            (you want it to be warm, even a little hot when you do this so the sugar dissolve)
            and whisk vigorously for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in the eggs one at a time, whisking 20 seconds after each addition.
             Whisk in the vanilla extract, espresso powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, mix in the cocoa powder and gluten-free flour until fully combined. 
            Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan. Smooth into an even layer. 
            Bake for 30-35 minutes until set and a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownies comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Cool the brownies for 30 minutes before cutting. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
